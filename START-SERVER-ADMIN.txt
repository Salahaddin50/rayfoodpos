HOW TO START THE SERVER (SOLUTION)
========================================

The issue: Windows Firewall/security is blocking PHP from binding to ports.

SOLUTION 1: Run as Administrator (Easiest)
------------------------------------------
1. Right-click on "start-server.bat" or "start-server-fixed.bat"
2. Select "Run as administrator"
3. The server should start on http://localhost:8000

SOLUTION 2: Allow PHP through Windows Firewall
-----------------------------------------------
1. Open Windows Security (Windows Defender)
2. Go to: Firewall & network protection > Allow an app through firewall
3. Click "Change settings" (if needed)
4. Click "Allow another app..." 
5. Browse to your PHP installation folder (usually C:\laragon\bin\php\php-8.3.x\php.exe)
6. Check both "Private" and "Public" boxes
7. Click OK

SOLUTION 3: Disable Firewall Temporarily (For Testing Only)
-------------------------------------------------------------
1. Open Windows Security
2. Go to: Firewall & network protection
3. Turn off firewall for Private network (temporarily for testing)
4. Try starting the server
5. Turn firewall back on after testing

SOLUTION 4: Check Antivirus Software
-------------------------------------
If you have third-party antivirus (not Windows Defender):
- Temporarily disable it and try starting the server
- Or add PHP.exe to the antivirus exceptions/allowlist

========================================
WHY THIS HAPPENED
========================================
Since it was working yesterday:
- Windows might have updated
- Firewall rules might have reset
- Antivirus might have updated and started blocking PHP

The "Failed to listen on 127.0.0.1:8000 (reason: ?)" error
is Windows blocking PHP from creating network listeners.
